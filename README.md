Aoa, adding some thing in Readme ( for issue workflow)
The Issue-Based Workflow is like a well-organized to-do list for your code.

Issue (The "What"): Every task starts here. It's a ticket that describes what needs to be done (e.g., "Fix the login button").
Branch (The "How"): To do the work without messing up the main code, you create a separate workspace named after the issue.
Pull Request (The "Review"): When the work is done on your branch, you submit it for review. This PR directly links your code changes back to the original issue.
Automation (The "Magic"): By adding words like Closes #15 to your PR, GitHub will automatically close the issue once the code is merged.
Project Board (The "Big Picture"): A visual dashboard (like a Kanban board with "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns) that tracks the progress of all your issues.
